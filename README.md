# Minesweeper Troll

This is a version of Minesweeper where it is impossible to win, while the map generation etc. adheres to modern Minesweeper rules. You can play the game here: https://anonymous1212144.github.io/Minesweeper/

More specifically, the board will always generate in a way that forces you to guess, but no matter what you guess, the mines will be regenerated so that your guess is wrong. Essentially, it is a Minesweeper where you're infinitely unlucky.

This is developed from https://github.com/DavidNHill/JSMinesweeper. If you want to play a legit game of Minesweepers go over there.
